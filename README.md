# zeb applied code challenge

This code challenge was completed during the interview process with zeb applied.
I took 3.5h for the first task, the second task was not attempted due to me already being over the alloted time of 2-3h.

I took quite a long time to understand the issue.
Adding to that were the missing request format and what `label` is when it's not on the third layer.
